# Jokebot privacy policy

Jokebot won't obtain any of your personal information, like your real name or phone number. The only things that we obtain are:

- Discord username: To diagnose errors and bugs.
- The action done by the bot (and url in case it's an image): Again, to diagnose and fix bugs and errors that may occur.

This data will never be sent to other companies or advertisers. Your data will be removed once the server is shut down, rebooted or in mantainance, unless the data contains important information for fixing a bug.
