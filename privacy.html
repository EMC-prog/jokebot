    </ul>
    <p>This data will never be sent to other companies or advertisers. Your data will be removed once the server is shut down, rebooted or in mantainance, unless the data contains important information for fixing a bug.
</p>
    <p><b>ALERT: IN A FEW WEEKS, THE DATA WILL BE SAVED ONTO A FILE INSTEAD, AND IT WILL BE ERASED EVERY CERTAIN TIME. STILL, THE FILE WILL NEVER BE GIVEN TO ANY ADVERTISING ENTERPRISE, SO IT WILL STAI ON THE HARD DISK OF THE SERVER AND NEVER EXIT IT.</b></p>
